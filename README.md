# Steps:
1.  create a directory named `sift` in the `dataset` directory. (In Unix, you can use the command `mkdir dataset/sift`)
2.  ./dataset/Q2.csv (for Q2) must be generated first. (You can generate it by the command `python Q2_Data_Generator.py`)
3.  ./dataset/sift/*.sift (for Q3&Q4) must be generated first. (You can generate it by the command `python Q3_SIFT_Generator.py`)
4.  ./dataset/Q3.csv (for Q3&Q4) must be generated first. (You can generate it by the command `python Q3_Data_Generator.py`)
5.  Check if the above data were generated before preprocessing with Q5_GUI.py
